We can't represent $19 \div 5$ as Natural Numbers also we can write it as fractions $3\frac {4}{5}$ 
**Rational numbers:** $\frac {p}{q}$ , p and q are integers p is numerators and q is denominators and $q \neq 0$ 
- Symbol $\mathbb{Q}$ to denote Rational Numbers
- gcd (p,q) = 1
- Same Numbers can be written on many form e.g ${5 \over 6 } = {10 \over 12}$ and it brings ease in addition subtraction multiplication and comparison
- These are dense - we can't talk what could be next rational number
