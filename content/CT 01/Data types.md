for [[Sanity of Data]] we need to introduce Data types so Restrictions Can be applied 

E.g [[Datasets]] of Report Card
- Name: Not contained special characters
- City: Should be a valid city name
- Marks: should lie b/w 0 to 100
- Gen: M or F only
- Date: Includes valid dates according to calendar
Data Type tells the computer or a human to Know how we are intending to use data
- Range, Operators Which will be done on it etc.

# Simple Datatypes
- [[Boolean]]
- [[Integers]]
- [[Characters]]

- [[Strings]] 
- [[Floats]]


# Complex Data types
[[Records]] 
[[Lists]]
# Reference
