# Number System
We use Numbers for helping us in counting like 1,2,3,4 and 0 for nothing 

## **![[Natural Numbers]]**

## ![[Integers]]
**Multiplication is a repeated addition like 7 x 4 means 4 groups of sevens exactly division is repeated Subtractions**

## Factors

3 mod 2 = 1
a divides b if a mod b = 0  and b will be a multiple of a b | a
here a | b are factors 
like {4,20} so 4 is factor of 20
factors occur in pairs until a number is no is perfect square so lest take 16
{1, 16}, {2, 8}, {4} here 4 x 4 = 16

## ![[Prime Numbers]]

# Greatest common divisor
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers is the greatest common factor number that divides them, exactly. It is also called theÂ [highest common factor (HCF)](https://byjus.com/maths/hcf/). For example, the greatest common factor of 15 and 10 is 5, since both the numbers can be divided by 5.
