# Natural Numbers

* This Numbers includes all Positive Numbers occurring
* The [[set]] of all natural numbers is standard denoted **N** or $\mathbb{N}$
 and if we add zero in it then it is represented as $\mathbb{N}\_0$ and $N\_o$ 
 
 Ok but if we perform operation on it does this always gives us ğŸ¤” Natural numbers a Big No for Example 11-12 = -1 which is not a Natural numbers
 means all the numbers can't be fit in this group ğŸ˜®
