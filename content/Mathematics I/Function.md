it is from inputs to outputs
X -> $X^2$  

- each input can have only one output

here X is an Input which is Parameter and $X^2$  is Output

Inputs: [[Domain]]
Outputs: [[Co Domain]] or [[Range]]


e.g 
f : X --> Y , [[Domain]] is X and Y is [[Co Domain]]   

## Association with [[Relation]]
We can use Relation for Function
e.g fucntion of square can have relation of 
$R_{sq} ={(x,y)| x, y \in \mathbb{R}, y = x^2}$  
- Additional Notation = y = $x^2$ 

$R_f \subset domain(f) \times range(f)$ 
- is Defined on entire Function 
- When we plot graph we use $R_f$ for Function

[[Slope]] and [[Intercept]] in a Function

## Types of Function
- [[Injective]]
- [[Surjective]]
- [[Bijective]]
-
