$p$ is prime number if it has only two factors {1, p}
- so 1 is not a prime number --> only one factor {1}
- Smallest prime is 2 and only even prime
- eg : 2,3,5,7,11,13...

**[[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] --> removes multiples of p**
It provides all prime numbers 

Every Number can be decomposed into prime factors
eg  12 = $2^2 \cdot 3$ => {$2^2 , 3$} and this is called prime factorizations
