### let $l_1$ and $l_2$ is two non -vertical lines (Non Verticals because slope will be undefined for Vertical lines) with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ with inclinations a and b 
### Parallel Lines
- if the two lines is parallel then there [[Slope]] will be same There can be Infinite Lines Like this
- So [[Slope]] can't uniquely Determined a line
- if lines were parallel their inclination is same
- so tan a = tan b
- hence $m_1$ and $m_2$ are same
So lines Which have same slope are Parallel Lines

### Perpendicular Lines
- if $l_1$ is perpendicular to $l_2$ then 90 + a = b
- Now tan B = tan (90 + a) = -cot a = -1/tan a
